## 1 Introduction
 
ScrabbleCoach™ is a simple, fast way to practice scrabble by adjusting the rules and focusing on creating words with
random letters. The letter symbols and scores can be selected by the user to allow for additional practice with
strategy.
 
## 2 Process Description
 
#### Inception
Establishment of all initial documentation and assessment of overall project.  A project plan and success criteria will also be established.  A refinement of requirements, creation of class diagrams, and initial use case model will be created and agreed upon. All major actors will be defined and all functional requirements have at least one use case.
Tentative architecture agreed.

*Entrance Criteria*
* Assignment/Requirements received.

*Exit Criteria*
* Requirements refinement via the class diagram and rational completed.
* Project plan completed.
* Initial use-case model created.
* Initial project glossary completed.
* Business Manager sign off on all use-cases and definitions.
 
#### Elaboration Phase 1
This phase is the beginning of the elaboration phase.  It will yield the completion of the majority of analysis of the product.  General architecture and all use cases should be identified and the majority of the use cases should be completed.

*Entrance criteria*
* Inception phase complete.

*Exit criteria*
* Majority of use-case model completed and business manager sign off on it.
* Preliminary user manual.
* Continued refinement of glossary.
 
#### Elaboration Phase 2
The completion of this phase will be the completion of the elaboration phase overall.  It does overlap somewhat with the Elaboration Phase 1, however, the results are discrete to those of phase 1.  The design model, use cases, and definition of the test cases are all complete.

*Entrance criteria*
* Inception phase complete.
* Majority of use-cases defined.

*Exit criteria*
* Use-case models completed.
* Design documentation completed.
* System Architecture completed.
* Test Plan cases defined.
 
#### Construction Phase 1
During this phase, the initial iteration of the system will be completed.  This will include the game backend.  All tests referring to the use cases implemented in this phase should be run and completed.

*Entrance criteria*
* Elaboration Phase complete.

*Exit criteria*
* Base functionality complete.
* Base test cases run with no errors.
* User manual populated with references to the use cases completed.
* Updates completed to design documents, project plans, test plans and supporting documents.
 
#### Construction Phase 2
During this phase, the next iteration of the game will be concluded.  This will include all UI designs, and can be done in tandem with phase 1.  Phase 2 will additionally include all API interfaces and implementations.  All tests referring to the use cases implemented in this phase should be run and completed.

*Entrance criteria*
* Use cases complete.
* Construction Phase 1 development complete, test cases do not need to be completed for this phase to begin.

*Exit criteria*
* Defined functionality complete.
* Test cases run with no errors.
* User manual populated with references to the use cases completed.
* Updates completed to design documents, project plans, test plans and supporting documents.
 
#### Construction Phase 3
During this phase, the final iteration of the system will be completed.  This will include all remaining functionality and interplay between all components.  All integration tests, unit tests, system tests, and user tests are completed. 

*Entrance criteria*
* Construction Phase 2 development complete, test cases do not need to be completed for this phase to begin.

*Exit criteria*
* All functionality complete, alpha release completed.
* All test cases run with no errors.
* User manual populated with references to the use cases completed.
* Updates completed to design documents, project plans, test plans and supporting documents.
 
#### Transition
The transition phase is the deployment to the user phase.  This includes all code as well as manuals.  Releasing the artifacts for general usage will of course return some bugs or slightly different expectations, all bugs need to be documented and tracked.  These changes will also be included in the transition phase.

*Entrance criteria*
* All Construction Phases complete.

*Exit criteria*
* All bugs documented and fixed.
* Product rollout ready.
* All documentation and code ready for full deployment.
