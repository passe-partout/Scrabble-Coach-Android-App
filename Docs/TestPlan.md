# Test Plan

**Author**: Team 87

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

The overall strategy for testing our app is to develop unit tests for each use case and we will automate our test cases using JUnit. We will then come up with integration tests to test overall interaction between classes. After that, we will do system tests on one of our team member's android phones to make sure the app is running per design documents. Finally, we will do regression test at the end of each phase to confirm that previous test cases which passed still pass. All of the team members will engage in each of our tests.

### 1.2 Test Selection

We will use both white box and black box techniques to test the code.  After reviewing next weeks video lectures, we will iterate upon this design.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

All unit tests must pass 100%.
All integration tests must pass 100%.
All regression tests must pass 100%.
All system tests must be in range of acceptable parameters.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

As issues arise within the design, we will utilize the issues tracking functionality within Github.

### 1.5 Technology

Currently, we plan to use JUnit to develop our unit, integration and system tests to ensure the integrity of our code.
